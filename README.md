Truth Table Checkers Game - Project Summary
Overview
I developed a comprehensive educational game that combines traditional checkers gameplay with discrete mathematics truth table practice. The game transforms learning logical operators into an engaging, interactive experience.

Core Features Implemented
Game Mechanics:

Single-player checkers vs AI opponent
Move validation requiring truth table problem solving
30-second timer per challenge
Scoring system (+2 correct, +5 captures, -1 skips)
Educational Components:

Logical Operators: AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IMPLIES (→), BICONDITIONAL (↔)
Implication Variants: P→Q, P→¬Q, ¬P→Q, ¬P→¬Q (as taught in discrete math courses)
Complex Expressions: Multi-operator combinations like (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)
Detailed Explanations: Rule-based feedback citing conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional principles
Technical Implementation:

Responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript architecture
Green color scheme matching user preferences
Proper truth table formatting with correct operator symbols
Error handling and data validation
Dynamic challenge generation
Files Created
index.html
 - Game structure and UI
styles.css
 - Visual styling and responsive design
script.js
 - Game logic, truth table evaluation, and AI opponent
Educational Value
The game successfully bridges the gap between theoretical discrete math concepts and practical application, making truth table practice engaging through gamification while maintaining academic rigor.
